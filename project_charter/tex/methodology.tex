LitHouse will be a web application that allows the user to control the LED lights from their phone or computer. The lights will be connected to the home network via raspberry pi that will also host the web server. The web server's UX/UI will be beginner friendly to allow the user to run, select, add, and create LED patterns. Users will be able to add their personality through the patterns by expressing certain features that each pattern can have which are music based, custom, or static patterns. The user can also show other people their custom patterns by submitting their patterns to a repository where other users can upload and download these patterns. All LED lights will be  waterproof.
